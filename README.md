#Github Fork Confirmation

Are you always accidentally forking repositories? I know I am. This Chrome Extension (or User Script!) will help. It adds a confirm dialog to the Fork button on Github repositories and Gists.

Available on the Chrome store:
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-fork-confirmation/mofjdkidemhjconaodballcmpnaofeod](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-fork-confirmation/mofjdkidemhjconaodballcmpnaofeod)

Or as a [User Script](source/UserScript/GithubForkConfirmation.user.js)

Here's what you can expect:
